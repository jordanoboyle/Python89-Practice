Here I am currently slowly building my skills in the Python programming language. Similar to the other practice files this will be split into various directories. 
Deliberate Practice:
  - This directory contains challenges from Actualize Bootcamp that are designed to promote a general smooth understanding of a language. Ultimately getting you to the point where nested loops, data container conversions, and data conversions become like second nature. 
  - This will be split into three sections, each getting progessively more difficult. 
    - Basic
    - Intermediate
    - Advanced
  - Questions are attached to the code specifically, so knowing the intended outputs and what the question wants you to do is easy. Although, some of the questions require the developer to determine their own outputs, which is best practices when doing challenges anyway. 

Over time there will be new Directories added to this repository. Depending on the source the file may contain multiple questions or a single, longer challenge. There will also be a NOTES section that will dive into more complex topics such as file manipulation, websraping, and data structures other than arrays, dictionaries, and sets. 

Eventual Inclusions:
Hacker Rank
Leet Code
Notes
Personal Problem Sets
Free Code Camp Problem Sets
Advent of Code (different years)
